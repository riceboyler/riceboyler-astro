          different titles:

            Like most full-time employed web developers, my personal site always
            seems to come last. It was the same when I was a car audio
            installer, my car was always the worst looking install (though I did
            make it sound good!).

            Initially, I'll work on the responsive side of things, as I know
            this isn't mobile friendly yet. Then, I'll probably only get the
            Resume/CV page built, because I plan to use this as a bit of a
            portfolio in and of itself. Eventually, I'll add a blog, a
            portfolio, a contact page, my car history, and the pretty crazy
            story of my finding my biological family.

          I used a bunch of modern technology (as of late 2021, updating in mid
          2025) to build this site. Here goes:
          <ul
            class={css({ listStyleType: 'disc', pl: 6, mt: 4, fontSize: 'xl' })}
          >
            <li>
              <a
                href='https://astro.build'
                rel='noopener noreferrer'
                target='_blank'>Astro!</a
              > - I finally made the switch from Next.js to Astro! Astro is a static
              site generator that allows you to build fast, modern websites with
              a focus on performance and simplicity. It's been a game changer for
              my personal projects.

                rel='noopener noreferrer'
                target='_blank'>TypeScript</a
              > - I used to hate it. Now I don't know how to ever go back to plain
              JavaScript again!

              > - a library for building UI components with a focus on accessibility
              and performance. It provides the best of CSS-in-JS while being precompiled
              via PostCSS. It's like Tailwind CSS, but without the nasty class names.

              enough to be the main host for Next.js apps.
